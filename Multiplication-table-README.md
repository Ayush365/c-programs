In this code,
we create a multiplication table using nested loops. The outer loop iterates through the rows, 
while the inner loop iterates through the columns. 
We use the `printf` function to print the multiplication result of the current row and column values.
Finally, we add a newline character after each row to separate the rows in the output.
